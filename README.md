# CloudAndMobileComputing
This is a repo for my course assignments. The course is about learning to produce mobile applications using mobile programming languages and cloud systems.

The programming language used is Java.

Assignment 3 is an app which displays a registration form in both portrait and landscape mode.

Assignment 4 is three different apps. The first one has a text view and two buttons. When the first button is clicked the application displays the current date and time and the second button clears it.

The second one displays a blog user interface. It can add user and comment and if there is no content, the background changes red. It is also able to search the given data.

The third one is a simple calculator app. It can do basic arithmetic operations of +,-,/ and *. I also added ability to clear and all clear and made it to look nice.
